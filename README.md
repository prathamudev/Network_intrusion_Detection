# Network_intrusion_Detection
This project is Created using IBM's cloud platform using No-code Machine Learning Tool provided by IBM ,

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement

Communication networks are increasingly vulnerable to cyber-attacks such as DoS, Probe, R2L, and U2R. Early detection of intrusions is critical to maintaining network integrity and preventing data breaches. This project aims to build a machine learning model that can analyze network traffic and classify activity as normal or potentially malicious.
